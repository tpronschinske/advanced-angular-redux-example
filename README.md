# Advanced Angular Redux Example

This project is an example of how to use Redux with API requests. We use the Redux library to load and store the products fetched from the server. We also separate out the store files to there own components to keep the AppStore cleaner and less bulky. 

I have used my own integrated Northwind API for this example which can be found at [Northwind](http://northwind.cooneycreative.net). This is a php based API with formatted json response models.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
